**ʿUmar Abū Sulaymān Rustum Khān son of Fāyiz, of Arab and Turk descent (Najdi through my father), and (a Qureshi Hashemite as well as a Turk through my mother.)**

A Muslim of the Shāfiʿī school of jurisprudence, and a rationalist in philosophy — in matters of the world, not of religion^[That is, I do not believe it is possible to subject any divine command or religious ruling to human reason or rationalism, as these originate from a source of higher complexity, greater wisdom, and supreme knowledge — most importantly: a non-human source. Hence, it is logically invalid to judge them by finite human standards limited to the seen world, let alone the unseen.].
Conservative in thought — or as Ibn Ḥanbal once said: _"I am fond of the ancient ways."_

As for profession:
1. A linguist and translator of tongues:  
	 - English  
	 - German of Germany  
	 - Anatolian Turkish — to and from these languages.
2. A Website & Software developer and database administrator.
3. A voice-over artist.
4. A teacher of Arabic to non-native speakers.
5. A teacher of English and German to Arabs.
6. An Arabiser and coiner of neologisms.

I delight in reading across genres of history, sociology, and linguistics.  

I regard myself as a humble student of the Qurʾān, the Sunnah, and the sacred sciences of the Sharīʿah.

I am fond of nature, greenery, equanimity of character, and the discipline and order of the military and its laws.

Do not be deceived by what you read, nor by the eloquence of the texts or the mastery of wordplay. I am a graduate of a department of linguistics and literature, and—as you’ve seen—a translator. My craft, at its core, is to enchant the text.

At first glance, you see nothing but what _I_ choose to show as the finest part of me. And so it is with all people: they merely present the best version of themselves.

People are dull creatures, no matter what masks of excitement they wear or how, in fleeting moments, a touch of difference appears on them.
