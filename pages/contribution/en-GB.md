If you find benefit in what I offer and wish to support it, the kindest thing you can do is remember me in your prayers — that, to me, is the greatest and most cherished gift.  
If you would like to support more directly, you’re welcome to purchase one of my products or make use of my services.

Please note that I don’t accept any financial support except in exchange for a product or a service. So if you’re not currently in need of either, the best way to contribute is by supporting one of my ongoing projects — like **Teryaq** or **Conquer** — where the support goes to the project, not to me personally.

God willing, I also plan to offer a profit-sharing model as another option for support in the near future.

As for what some people are used to — simply sending money as a gift, large or small — I currently do not accept such direct donations. Nonetheless, I’m deeply grateful for your kind intention and generous spirit ❤️.
